      One thing I know, living on this doggone Earth, is that the briefer my
      point is the better. Here is <strike> Johnny!</strike> the app that lets
      you virtually bury someone. What for? Because what I have left from people
      that died not so long ago is just dead social network accounts. It is just
      sad to watch someone's avatar and reread those messages sent while they
      were alive. So much untold... And the account becomes a ghost that
      haunting every night. I guess people need some relief. A way to direct all
      sorrow so the ghost could finally rest.
      <br /> Thus here is my personal digital graveyard. You see I believe that
      in the modern days it is extremely important to left a digital
      fingerprint. In my opinion the blockchain is the answer. My dream is to
      make commemoration of someone in the digital world a common practice. So
      this is my first step towards this.
      <br /> It is only beta by far but in the future I wanna wire up all that
      good decentralized techy stuff you know: blockchain, tokens, smart
      contracts... Just imagine the world where the data about a person died is
      not scripted on a tombstone but is available to commemorate for everyone
      and also decentralized. Isn't it just mind-boggling?
      <br />
      For now you might wanna go to the main page clicking on the icon on the
      left on the top bar and create a grave. All you need to do is tap or click
      on an empty cell and the menu will give you a hint what to do next.
      <br />
      Ye be warned that while there are only 12 cells I may delete some of
      those. So don't be surprised if once you will not find your burial
      because: while it is only a beta I need to free up some space for
      everybody who wants to create some graves! <be />
      So yeah. I promised to be brief by damn my talkativeness. You can contact
      me at{" "}

      Feel free to propose some good ideas but don't bother me with some
      non-important stuff.
      <br />
      <br /> Bye.
